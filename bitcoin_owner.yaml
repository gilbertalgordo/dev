I, Gilbert Algordo (g.dev/gilbert_algordo), request transfer/ownership verification for bitcoin.org maintainership.
Date: 2025-11-05
I control the PGP key with fingerprint: <your-fingerprint>



gpg --armor --sign --local-user <your-key-id> --output claim.sig claim.txt



Hi bitcoin.org maintainers,

I’m Gilbert Algordo (g.dev/gilbert_algordo). I’m requesting transfer/ownership consideration for contributor/developer access to the bitcoin.org project.

Reason: [briefly state purpose—e.g., ongoing maintenance, security upgrades, documentation work]
Proofs of control I can provide:
- Bitcoin-address signature: address: [your BTC address], message and base64 signature available.
- PGP-signed claim using key fingerprint: [your PGP fingerprint].
- DNS TXT record at [your-domain] with the verification token you request.

Contributions: [link to PRs, commits, issues, or other relevant work]

I’m happy to follow any governance steps you require, provide additional verification, or join a transition period to ensure continuity.

Thanks for considering this. I look forward to your instructions.

— Gilbert Algordo
