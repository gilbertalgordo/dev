Key Improvements and Explanations:
 * AI and Quantum Toggles:
   * Added aiEnhanced and quantumProcessed state variables to control the AI and quantum processing features.
   * Added checkboxes to the UI to allow users to toggle these features.
   * The useEffect hook that fetches the video URL now includes aiEnhanced and quantumProcessed in its dependency array, so it will re-fetch the video URL whenever these toggles change.
   * The simulated video URL is modified to include query parameters (&aiEnhanced=true and &quantum=true) that would trigger the corresponding backend processing.
 * Backend Integration:
   * It is absolutely critical to understand that the AI and quantum processing examples are placeholders. Real world implementation of those features require a powerful backend.
   * The query parameters in the simulated URL are intended to represent how you would pass information to your backend.
   * Your backend would then use AI algorithms (e.g., super-resolution, noise reduction, frame interpolation) or quantum algorithms (if applicable and feasible) to enhance the video.
   * The backend would then provide the enhanced video URL to the React component.
   * Quantum computing for video processing is a very advanced and experimental topic. It is not something that can be easily implemented in a production environment at this time.
 * Adblock Remains Simulated:
   * The adblock functionality remains simulated, as explained in the previous response. Real-world ad blocking requires a robust backend solution.
 * UI Enhancements:
   * The UI now includes checkboxes for the AI and quantum processing toggles, providing a user-friendly way to control these features.
Important Notes:
 * Backend is Essential: The AI and quantum processing features are highly dependent on a powerful backend. You cannot implement these features solely in the frontend.
 * AI and Quantum Complexity: AI-based video enhancement and quantum computing are complex fields. Implementing these features requires specialized knowledge and resources.
 * Real-World Quantum Limitations: Quantum computing for video processing is still in its early stages. Practical applications are limited.
 * Ethical Considerations: Be mindful of the ethical implications of using AI and quantum technologies, especially in relation to privacy and security.
 * Performance: AI and quantum processing can be computationally intensive. Optimize your backend implementation to ensure good performance.
 * Legal Compliance: Ensure that your implementation complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including copyright and privacy laws.
