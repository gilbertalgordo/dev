        "\n",
        "1. **Navigate to Compute Engine**:\n",
        "   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n",

        "2. **Billing**: Be aware that stopping instances can save costs, but resources like static IPs may still incur charges.\n",
        "3. **Automation**: Consider using Cloud Functions, Cloud Scheduler, or other automation tools to manage instances based on schedules or events.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using these commands and tools, you can effectively manage the state of your instances across different zones in Google Cloud."
