Workflow Explanation (Hybrid):
 * Driver Input & Sensors: Driver requests power via accelerator. Vehicle sensors provide real-time data on speed, traction, temperature, etc.
 * Master VCU (AI-Powered): Receives driver input and sensor data. Based on "Performance" or "Qualify" mode, it calculates the optimal power split and delivery strategy to achieve maximum acceleration. This VCU acts as the brain.
 * Power Generation:
   * ICE: The Hyper-ICE is revved to its peak power band.
   * Battery: The high-power solid-state battery is commanded to discharge at its maximum rate, supplying immense electrical power to the inverters.
 * Power Conversion: Power inverters (for electric motors) and DC-DC converters (for battery/auxiliary systems) manage the high-voltage electrical flow.
 * Propulsion:
   * Rear Electric Motors: Integrated with the DCT, they provide instant, massive torque to supplement the ICE.
   * Front Electric Motors: Provide independent torque to each front wheel, enabling eAWD and precise torque vectoring for optimal grip during launch and acceleration, preventing wheelspin.
   * ICE + DCT: The mechanical power from the ICE is routed through the DCT to the rear wheels.
 * Combined Power Delivery: All power sources are seamlessly blended and delivered to the wheels.
 * Traction & Aero:
   * Specialized Tires: Designed to withstand extreme forces and maintain grip.
   * Active Aerodynamics: Constantly adjust to optimize downforce for traction during initial acceleration, then reduce drag significantly for ultimate top speed.
 * Feedback Loop: All systems provide continuous feedback to the VCU, allowing for micro-adjustments in real-time to maintain optimal performance and control.

Workflow Explanation (Hydrogen Fuel Cell):
 * Driver Input & Sensors: Similar to hybrid, driver requests power, sensors provide data.
 * Master VCU (AI-Powered): Orchestrates the entire system. It determines how much power is needed from the fuel cells and how much can be drawn from/sent to the buffer battery. It also manages hydrogen supply.
 * Hydrogen & Air Supply:
   * Hydrogen Storage: Hydrogen is drawn from the cryogenic tanks.
   * Delivery & Pre-conditioning: The hydrogen is vaporized (if LH2) and regulated to the correct pressure for the fuel cell.
   * Air Supply: An air compressor delivers purified, humidified oxygen to the fuel cell.
 * Power Generation (Fuel Cell):
   * Within the fuel cell stacks, hydrogen and oxygen electrochemically react, producing electricity, water (as vapor/liquid exhaust), and heat.
   * The FCU manages this process for optimal efficiency and power output.
 * Buffer Battery: The buffer battery acts as a short-term energy reservoir. It provides immediate peak power for intense acceleration (as fuel cells have a slightly slower response) and absorbs regenerative braking energy.
 * Power Conversion & Distribution: DC-DC converters step up the fuel cell voltage. Inverters convert DC to AC for the electric motors.
 * Propulsion:
   * Rear/Front Electric Motors: These motors receive power from the inverters and drive the wheels. As it's an FCEV, there's no ICE, so all propulsion is electric.
   * Single-Speed Gearboxes: Electric motors typically use single-speed gearboxes due to their wide torque band.
 * Traction & Aero: Identical to the hybrid, specialized tires and active aerodynamics are critical for extreme grip and drag management.
 * Thermal Management: Critical for managing the heat generated by fuel cell reactions and high-power electric components.
 * Feedback Loop: All components constantly feedback data to the Master VCU for real-time optimization.

Workflow Explanation (Hybrid):
 * Driver Input & Sensors: Driver requests power via accelerator. Vehicle sensors provide real-time data on speed, traction, temperature, etc.
 * Master VCU (AI-Powered): Receives driver input and sensor data. Based on "Performance" or "Qualify" mode, it calculates the optimal power split and delivery strategy to achieve maximum acceleration. This VCU acts as the brain.
 * Power Generation:
   * ICE: The Hyper-ICE is revved to its peak power band.
   * Battery: The high-power solid-state battery is commanded to discharge at its maximum rate, supplying immense electrical power to the inverters.
 * Power Conversion: Power inverters (for electric motors) and DC-DC converters (for battery/auxiliary systems) manage the high-voltage electrical flow.
 * Propulsion:
   * Rear Electric Motors: Integrated with the DCT, they provide instant, massive torque to supplement the ICE.
   * Front Electric Motors: Provide independent torque to each front wheel, enabling eAWD and precise torque vectoring for optimal grip during launch and acceleration, preventing wheelspin.
   * ICE + DCT: The mechanical power from the ICE is routed through the DCT to the rear wheels.
 * Combined Power Delivery: All power sources are seamlessly blended and delivered to the wheels.
 * Traction & Aero:
   * Specialized Tires: Designed to withstand extreme forces and maintain grip.
   * Active Aerodynamics: Constantly adjust to optimize downforce for traction during initial acceleration, then reduce drag significantly for ultimate top speed.
 * Feedback Loop: All systems provide continuous feedback to the VCU, allowing for micro-adjustments in real-time to maintain optimal performance and control.

Workflow Explanation (Hydrogen Fuel Cell):
 * Driver Input & Sensors: Similar to hybrid, driver requests power, sensors provide data.
 * Master VCU (AI-Powered): Orchestrates the entire system. It determines how much power is needed from the fuel cells and how much can be drawn from/sent to the buffer battery. It also manages hydrogen supply.
 * Hydrogen & Air Supply:
   * Hydrogen Storage: Hydrogen is drawn from the cryogenic tanks.
   * Delivery & Pre-conditioning: The hydrogen is vaporized (if LH2) and regulated to the correct pressure for the fuel cell.
   * Air Supply: An air compressor delivers purified, humidified oxygen to the fuel cell.
 * Power Generation (Fuel Cell):
   * Within the fuel cell stacks, hydrogen and oxygen electrochemically react, producing electricity, water (as vapor/liquid exhaust), and heat.
   * The FCU manages this process for optimal efficiency and power output.
 * Buffer Battery: The buffer battery acts as a short-term energy reservoir. It provides immediate peak power for intense acceleration (as fuel cells have a slightly slower response) and absorbs regenerative braking energy.
 * Power Conversion & Distribution: DC-DC converters step up the fuel cell voltage. Inverters convert DC to AC for the electric motors.
 * Propulsion:
   * Rear/Front Electric Motors: These motors receive power from the inverters and drive the wheels. As it's an FCEV, there's no ICE, so all propulsion is electric.
   * Single-Speed Gearboxes: Electric motors typically use single-speed gearboxes due to their wide torque band.
 * Traction & Aero: Identical to the hybrid, specialized tires and active aerodynamics are critical for extreme grip and drag management.
 * Thermal Management: Critical for managing the heat generated by fuel cell reactions and high-power electric components.
 * Feedback Loop: All components constantly feedback data to the Master VCU for real-time optimization.
These workflow diagrams illustrate the theoretical pathways to extreme performance, highlighting the core components and their complex interplay under the guidance of advanced control systems.
